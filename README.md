## Organising a future R User Day

To add content for a new event:
	
1. Create a new folder named with the date of the event in YYYY-MM-DD format.
	
2. Create a new folder within the new event folder called `slides`.
	
3. Copy the `agenda.qmd` file from the previous R user day to the new event folder and update dates and content as required.

4. Add a new entry to `index.qmd` to link to the agenda for the new event.
